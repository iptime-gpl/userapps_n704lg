CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
DSCP match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_DSCP
  This option adds a `DSCP' match, which allows you to match against
  the IPv4 header DSCP field (DSCP codepoint).

  The DSCP codepoint can have any value between 0x0 and 0x4f.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
