  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
  table.  

  You can use this target to set the ECN bits from the IPv4 and TCP header
  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
  ECN support in general.
