CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT
Local NAT support
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL
  This option enables support for NAT of locally originated connections. 
  Enable this if you need to use destination NAT on connections
  originating from local processes on the nat box itself.

  Please note that you will need a recent version (>= 1.2.6a)
  of the iptables userspace program in order to use this feature.
  See http://www.iptables.org/ for download instructions.

  If unsure, say 'N'.
